Hi,

I'm Leo, a {{% age %}} years old, graduated on computer science at Instituto de Matemática e Estatística of Universidade de São Paulo (IME-USP). Researching web applications on distributed and parallel systems. FullStack developer, security enthusiast, game player and coffee addicted.

Welcome to my site. I enjoy studying system scalability, distributed web applications and , eventually, hack around. I will stick with the canonical definition: I'm machine who transform code into coffee.

You can talk to me in:

{{< list items="Ruby,JavaScript,PHP,Java,Python,C,Bash" >}}

Feel free to visit my [blog]({{< blog >}}). Or, you can contact me as well, let's have a fun conversation, just [email me](mailto:{{% mail %}}).

If you want discuss about coding, mainly about backend, server infrastructure, Kubernetes, and distributed systems, shoot me a message.

Here is my social media:

And for today, that's all folks!
