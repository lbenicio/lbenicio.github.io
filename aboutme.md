Hi,

I'm Leo, a {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:1994 }} years old, graduated on computer science at Instituto de Matemática e Estatística of Universidade de São Paulo (IME-USP). Researching web applications on distributed and parallel systems. FullStack developer, security enthusiast, game player and coffee addicted. 

Welcome to my site. I enjoy studying system scalability, distributed web applications and , eventually, hack around. I will stick with the canonical definition: I'm machine who transform code into coffee.

You can talk to me in:

- Ruby

- JavaScript

- PHP

- Java

- Python

- C

- Bash

Feel free to visit my [blog]({{site.blog}}). Or, you can contact me as well, let's have a fun conversation, just [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}).

If you want discuss about coding, mainly about backend, server infrastructure, Kubernetes, and distributed systems, shoot me a message.
